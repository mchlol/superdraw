Starting point is [this tutorial from SuperHi](https://library.superhi.com/posts/how-to-draw-and-paint-using-html-canvas) and then I mucked around with it a little bit for fun. 

The colours are based on the original 8 Crayola crayon colours, I found some approximations of their hex codes at [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_crayola.asp). 

The icons are *loosely* based on some Crayola stamp pens I had as a kid. There was definitely an eye and a heart. I used [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons); disappointed the eye doesn't have eyelashes because that one was my favourite. 

This is my third 'sketch' project, after the semi-abandoned [Pixel Sketchpad](https://mchlol.github.io/etchasketch/) (WIP) and then of course the rainbow goofiness of the more realistic Etchasketch (part of the [Beginner Javascript](https://beginnerjavascript.com) course).


### TO-DO

- Don't want to clutter the canvas but some short instructions might not be a bad idea.
- I think it would be cute to make the stamp pen a reality.
- A color picker would also be fun...
- ...along with options for brush sizes. 
- Must also solve the canvas resize issue.
